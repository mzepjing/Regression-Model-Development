# Introduction

With the growing popularity of meal kit purchases in the United States, companies in the semi-prepared meal delivery industry are competing to meet the demands of consumers. Meal kits have become a popular choice for many people due to their convenience and the inclusion of new and healthy recipes, saving time on shopping, preparation, and cooking. According to Nielsen, 1 in 4 adults in the US have purchased a meal kit in the last year, and 70% of them continue to buy them after their first purchase. With more than half of Americans using diet to prevent ailments, meal kits are a simple option for those looking to manage their health and diets (Nielsen, 2017).

The aim of this is to forecast future revenue using a regression model based on existing data. In this analysis, a variety of factors will be examined that can impact revenue. By using a regression model, we can identify patterns and trends in the data and use them to make informed predictions about revenue in the future. The goal is to provide insights that can help businesses make data-driven decisions about their revenue strategies and improve their financial performance. So, let's dive in and explore how this regression model can help predict revenue.





# Final Result

The testing score of 0.8085 suggests that the Unpruned GBM model performs well on the test dataset, but there is a gap of 0.024 between the training score and testing score, indicating that the model may have overfit to the training data. Therefore, it may be beneficial to apply some form of regularization or pruning techniques to the model to improve its generalization performance on unseen data.
